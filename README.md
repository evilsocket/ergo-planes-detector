`planes-detector` is an [ergo](https://github.com/evilsocket/ergo) based project that relies on a convolutional neural network to detect airplanes from satellite imagery.

#### Training

Download the [PlanesNet dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rhammell/planesnet) (the zip file with pictures) and extract it somewhere, then:

    ergo train /path/to/planes-detector --dataset /path/to/planesnet/pictures

This will make ergo preprocess the pictures, import them as a csv dataset and start the training algorithm (see [how to train on GPU](https://github.com/evilsocket/ergo#enable-gpu-support)) that can be monitored with `tensorboard` (`logs` folder).

After training is completed, you can view the model structure and how the accuracy and loss metrics changed during training with:

    ergo view /path/to/planes-detector

#### Evaluation

Once the training is completed, you can clean the project from temporary datasets and start a REST API server to test the model:

    cd /path/to/planes-detector
    ergo clean .
    ergo serve .

You can test the predictions with `curl`:

    curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/?x=/path/to/filename.jpg

Alternatively you can use the file `model.h5` (created inside the project folder after training) by loadeding it as you would normally do with Keras API for evaluation.
